        <li class="li">CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
        <li class="li">CSS describes how HTML. element are to be displayed on screen, pape, or in other media.</li>
        <li class="li"> <span class="delete">Css is not neccesary</span> <span class="background">CSS saves a lot of work.</span> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once </li>

     <h3 class="Heading1">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h3>
     <ul class="unlist" >
        <li>Inline-by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
        <li>Internal-by using style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External-by using link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <span class="background">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span>because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
     </ul>
     <p class="footer">When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiole elements.ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript. </p>
     <p class="footer">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page.Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
     <p class="footer">There is a wide range ofselectors available.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied</p>
